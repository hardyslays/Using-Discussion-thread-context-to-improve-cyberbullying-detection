# Using-Discussion-thread-context-to-improve-cyberbullying-detection

## Abstract:
Cyberbullying is the act of harassing, demeaning, or threatening someone via technology such as social networking, texting, or instant messaging. It is defined as “willful and repeated harm inflicted through the medium of electronic text” (Patchin and Hinduja 2006:152) [1]. Cyberbullying is an underlying problem in social networking services, threatening users' mental and physical health. The aim of this study is to improve the detection of cyberbullying in discussion threads by utilizing the repeated negative context formed in the presence of cyberbullying.

## Problem statement:
Current cyberbullying detection systems work by tagging individual sentences seperately by utilizing some kind of machine learning or knowledge based approach (or a combo of these two). This is acceptable when wer are trying to predict the cyberbullying aspects in some limited communication environment. But in scenarios where people are talking in groups and having proper communications, such as social media platforms or discussion forums, we cannot predict the Cyberbullying traits by just looking at the individual sentences or comments by individual people.

In this scenario, we need to take in consideration the total contextual information of the whole discussion and figure out if cyberbullying is present in the discussion or not. Cyberbullying, in this case, can be defined as a repititive negative or hostile intent of a person or a group of people towards a subject (individual or group of similar interests).

In our study, we have proposed a novel approach to extract the contextual information of the discussion and use it along with sentimental analysis to predict if Cyberbullying is present in a disccusion thread or not.
